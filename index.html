</ul>

<p>Button "one" would be expected to be the initial focus target on load, because it's the first focusable element.</p>

<p>However, button "three" has <code>scrollIntoView</code> called on load. In browsers that exhibit this bug, when <kbd>Tab</kbd> is pressed to enter the page, button "Four" is targeted instead.</p>  

<script>
document.getElementById('target').scrollIntoView();
</script>
